#Complete a program that reads four values from input
#and stores the values in variables:
#first_name, generic_location, whole_number, and plural_noun.
#The program then uses the input values to output a short story.
#The first input statement is provided in the code as an example.

first_name = input("First name:")
generic_location = input("Location:")
whole_number = int(input("Number:"))
plural_noun = input("Plural noun:")

print(first_name, 'went to', generic_location, 'to buy', whole_number, 'different types of', plural_noun)
